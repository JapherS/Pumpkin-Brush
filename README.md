## Project Overview
Pumpkin Brush is a desktop painting application developed to enable multiple users to collaboratively paint. The painting collaboration operates in real time which functions like Google Docs. One user's activities (e.g., drawing on canvas) are always reflected on other users' canvas in real-time. This is implemented by using networking and threading. A UI window (apart from the canvas window) is also implemented, which it functions as a toolbox containing a variaty of function buttons (e.g., redo drawing). 

## Features
- Draw
- Change drawing color ï¼ˆi.e., black, red, green, blue, white, yellow, magenta, cyan)
- Change drawing size (i.e., small, medium, large)
- Change drawing shape (i.e., brush, pen)
- Undo
- Redo
- Clear canvas 
- Erase 
- Change canvas background color (i.e., white, black, yellow, green)

## Language
Pumpkin Brush is written in C++ and SFML.
